# Mafia-Bot
A Discord Bot to facilitate games of mafia.

## Usage

A full set of instructions will be written at a later date. However, to summarize, you'll need to self-host the bot by setting up a bot on the Discord Developer Portal and running it locally. Install Node.js, NPM, and all the dependencies imported in the source using `require()`. Create a config.json file using the client secret from the Discord Developer Portal.
