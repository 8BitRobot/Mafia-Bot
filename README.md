# Mafia-Bot
A Discord Bot to facilitate games of mafia.

## Usage

You'll need to self-host the bot by setting up a bot on the Discord Developer Portal and running it locally. Install Node.js, NPM, and all the dependencies using `npm install`. Create a `config.json` in the root directory file using the client secret from the Discord Developer Portal.
